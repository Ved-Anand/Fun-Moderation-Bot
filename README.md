# Meet Fyre, a simple moderation bot!
Fyre is a relatively lightweight moderation bot for <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> intended for moderation, yet it also contains a variety of other features. Fyre is built using the powerful <a href="https://discord.js.org/" target="_blank">discord.js library</a>.

## Setup:
1. Install a node.js version of 16 or higher, if not already having done so.
2. Clone/Download this repository.
3. Install the neccessary dependencies by running `npm install`
4. If not already done, create a discord bot application [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
5. Make a copy of the botconfig example.json file, and put it in the same folder. Make sure to name this file botconfig.json. Next, open a file editor, and replace the token/ownerid keys with the correct values. If you don't know how to get your id, click [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-). The bot's token can be found by clicking on your bot application, clicking on Bot to the left, and copying your token there. 
6. Please note that if you are going to upload this code to github, make sure that your token is invisible. If your token is public any random person can control the bot. By default if it is in a botconfig.json file, the .gitignore should hide it if you for example fork the repo.
7. Add the bot to your server. You can generate an invite link on the application page. Make sure to give the bot administrator, as well as scopes of applications.commands and bot.
8. Run the bot by typing `npm start`, if an error occurs right as you do this command, you may want to type `npm test`, which will let you know if you have npm module(s) missing. The default prefix for the bot is $.
