## Setup:
1. Install a node.js version 16 or higher, if not already having done so.
2. Clone/Download this repository.
3. Install the neccessary dependencies by running `npm ci`
4. If not already done, create a discord bot application [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
5. Make a copy of the botconfig example.json file, and put it in the same folder. Make sure to name this file botconfig.json. Next, open a file editor, and replace the token/ownerid keys with the correct values. If you don't know how to get your id, click [here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-). The bot's token can be found by clicking on your bot application, clicking on Bot to the left, and copying your token there. 
6. Please note that if you are going to upload this code to github, make sure that your token is invisible. If your token is public any random person can control the bot. This can easily be done by creating a .gitignore file, and putting in botconfig.json there. You may as well put in node_modules/ too. If this is confusing, simply look up how to use a .gitignore file.
7. Add the bot to your server.
8. Run the bot by typing `npm start`, if an error occurs right as you do this command, you may want to type `npm test`, which will let you know if you have npm module(s) missing. Note: When the bot is running, the default prefix for the bot is !

## Commands:

### Moderating:
`$addrole <user> <role-name>` Add a role to someone. <br />
`$ban <user> <reason?>` Ban a misbehavior for whatever reason. <br />
`$kick <user> <reason?>` Someone getting on your nerves, yet not enough so that you would ban them? The kick command is right for you. <br />
`$mute <user> <reason?>` Stop someone from talking if they are spamming/etc. <br />
`$nick <user>` Change someone's nickname with this command. <br />
`$purge <amount>` This command will let you quickly delete messages from a channel. <br />
`$removerole <user> <role-name>` The counter to $addrole, this command will let you quickly remove a role from someone. <br />
`$unmute <user>` The counter to $mute, this command will unmute someone who is muted, and let them talk again. <br />
`$warn <user> <reason>` Someone starting to misbehave. Warn them to see if they'll stop. If they don't stop, more drastic action such as the $kick and $ban command may have to be used...
### Fun
`$8ball <question>` Get a somewhat cheesy answer to a question you may have. <br />
`$cat` [CURRENTLY BROKEN] If you are a cat person.<br />
`$dog` The follow up to `$cat`, but if you are a dog person.<br />
`$meme` [CURRENTLY BROKEN] These memes come straight from [r/dankmemes](https://reddit.com/r/dankmemes/)
### Owner
`$eval <code>` Quickly evaluate some code. If you're editing the code, be sure to not let only the most trusted people use this command, as very dangerous things can happen if you let everyone use this command. <br />
`$reload <command-name>` If you've just made a change to a command, and are tired of having to constantly restart the npm process each time you want your changes to go through, reload will quickly do it for you. <br />
`$shutdown` Shuts down the bot.
### Other
`prefix <string>` Change the prefix the bot answers to. Currently only one character is allowed. <br /> 
`$botinfo` Get some stats on the bot. <br />
`$help <command-name?>` Saying just $help will cause the bot to send you a list of the commands, if you type a command name, the bot will you give more detailed information on that command itself. <br />
`$helpmsg <number>` Every so now and then, you may get an error from the bot, and an error code will be sent into the channel. You can look up these errors with the $helpmsg command, and see what exactly they are. <br />
`$ping` Get's the bot's ping. <br />
`$serverinfo` Get some stats on the server you're in. <br />
`$urban <query>` Ask the urban dictionary about something. <br />
